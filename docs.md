# Documentation for Hackers Fun Fact Generator

## Overview
The Hackers Fun Fact Generator is designed to provide users with interesting facts about hackers. The application is built using basic web technologies and is easy to extend.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for generating facts.
- `README.md`: A file that provides an overview of the project.
- `docs.md`: Documentation for the project.

## How It Works
1. The `index.html` file contains a button and a display area for the facts.
2. The `script.js` file contains an array of fun facts and a function to randomly select one when the button is clicked.
3. The `style.css` file styles the application, including setting the background images and text styles.

## Customization
You can customize the facts and background images by modifying the arrays in `script.js` and `style.css`.
